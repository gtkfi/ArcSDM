# ArcSDM
Spatial Data Modeler 5 for ArcGis pro<Br>

## How to get started? <br>

Standard toolbox of ArcSDM 5 works on ArcGis Desktop 10.3-10.7.1, however the Experimental toolbox requires components that cannot be installed on ArcGis desktop and doesn't work. ArcGis pro is supported from version 2.5+ forward.


If you want to work on your own data, you can download just the toolbox. If you want to try, evaluate and experiment with ArcSDM you can download our demodata separately from the main package. <br>

ArcSDM wiki contains upto date howtopage: https://github.com/gtkfi/ArcSDM/wiki/Howto-start


### Toolbox <br>
Click "Clone or download" and select the suitable download option for you. "Download Zip" is the safe and easy choice, just open the zip anywhere you like and add the toolbox to ArcGis (Desktop or Pro). <br>

### Demodata <br>
Download the demodata as a zip package from our demodata git repository https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata. You can download the release file from here https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata/releases/download/v1.0/ArcSDM_Demodata.zip <br>
Open and save the zip optionally to your ArcSDM toolbox installation folder as "Data" folder. Then click "initworkdir.bat" to create (or overwrite older) working copy. <br>
