# ArcSDM
Spatial Data Modeler 5 for ArcGis pro<Br>

## How to get started? <br>

ArcSDM 5 works on ArcGis Desktop 10.3-10.5.1 and partially in 10.6, however Experimental toolbox requires components that cannot be installed on ArcGis desktop 10.6 and thus doesn't work! ArcGis pro is again supported from version 2.5+ forward.


If you want to work against your own data, you can download just the toolbox. If you want to try, evaluate and experiment with ArcSdm you can download our demodata separately from the main package. <br>

ArcSDM wiki contains upto date howtopage: https://github.com/gtkfi/ArcSDM/wiki/Howto-start


### Toolbox <br>
Click "Clone or download" and select suitable download option for you. "Download Zip" is the safe and easy choice, just open the zip anywhere you like and add the toolbox to ArcGis (Desktop or Pro). <br>

### Demodata <br>
Download the demodata as a zip package from our demodata git repository https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata. You can download the release file from here https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata/releases/download/v1.0/ArcSDM_Demodata.zip <br>
Open and save the zip optionally to your ArcSDM toolbox installation folder as "Data" folder. Then click "initworkdir.bat" to create (or overwrite older) working copy. <br>
