# ArcSDM

Spatial Data Modeler 6 for ArcGIS Pro 3.0+

---

## How to get started?

ArcSDM 6 is designed to work with ArcGIS Pro 3.0 and higher. The standard toolbox of ArcSDM 6 requires components that are compatible with ArcGIS Pro. Ensure you have ArcGIS Pro 3.0 or later installed to use ArcSDM 6 effectively.

If you want to work on your own data, you can download just the toolbox. If you want to try, evaluate and experiment with ArcSDM you can download our demodata separately from the main package. <br>

ArcSDM wiki contains a howtopage: https://github.com/gtkfi/ArcSDM/wiki/Howto-start

### Toolbox <br>
Click "Clone or download" and select the suitable download option for you. "Download Zip" is the safe and easy choice, just open the zip in a place where ArcGIS Pro has access in your computer and add the toolbox to ArcGIS Pro. <br>

### Compatibility
ArcSDM 6 is designed for:
- **ArcGIS Pro:** Version 3.0 or higher
- **Python Environment:** Python 3.9 or later (managed through ArcGIS Pro's Conda environment)

### Demodata <br>
Download the demodata as a zip package from our demodata git repository https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata. You can download the release file from here https://github.com/gtkfi/demodata/releases/download/v1.0/ArcSDM_Demodata.zip <br>
Open and save the zip optionally to your ArcSDM toolbox installation folder as "Data" folder. Then click "initworkdir.bat" to create (or overwrite older) working copy. <br>

## Usage of the ArcSDM Python env

At the moment is this advised to clone the ArcGIS Pro Python env and downloading the necessary packages to the cloned Python env.
Do not clone it to the default AppData folder. This might cause the required packages to not install.
Please clone the Python env to for example C:\user\path_to_a_folder\arcpy-py3-env

## Setting Up ArcSDM Python Environment

To use ArcSDM with ArcGIS Pro, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    - Open ArcGIS Pro.
    - Navigate to `Project` -> `Package Manager`.
    - Clone the environment (not in the default location) to your local machine.

2. **Change ArcGIS Pro to Use ArcSDM Python Environment**:
    - Set ArcGIS Pro to use the `arcsdm-py3-env` environment.

3. **Restart ArcGIS Pro**:
    - Close and reopen ArcGIS Pro to apply the changes.
    - Add Packages Scikit-learn (1.30 <= x <= 1.5), Tensorflow and Imbalanced-learn by searching those libraries:

    - Sometimes packages do not install due to Proxy settings. Please retry, turn off your VPN or contact your organizations IT Help to enable the installation.

4. **Install Required Packages**:
    - Open the cloned Python environment in ArcGIS Pro.
    - Use the Package Manager to search for and install the following packages:
        - Scikit-learn (1.30 <= x <= 1.5)
        - TensorFlow
    - If you encounter issues due to proxy settings, retry the installation or contact your IT support for assistance.

By following these steps, you will have the necessary environment set up to use ArcSDM with ArcGIS Pro.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Missing Dependencies
If dependencies fail to install, verify that you are using the correct Python environment for ArcGIS Pro.

### Issue: Toolbox Not Showing
Ensure that the toolbox file (`ArcSDM.pyt`) is in a folder accessible to ArcGIS Pro and that itâ€™s properly added to the project.

### Logs and Support
For error messages or unexpected behavior, check the ArcGIS Pro **Geoprocessing > History** pane for details.
